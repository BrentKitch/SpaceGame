# Space Game
## Made by Brent, Justin, and Nathanael

This game represents a two-week collaboration between Brent, Justin, and Nathanael. It is a space trading game in which you are required to save up 10,002 Starbucks (the game's currency) in order to rescue the princess. If you die (or reach the age of 65 without saving her) you lose. Otherwise, you can save her, and this constitutes a "good" ending.

## How to play

In order to rescue the princess, you need to save money. In order to save money, you must navigate the galaxy, purchasing goods. Controls are displayed on-screen at all times. Different planets sell different items, and different planets prefer different types of items. To make a profit, you must buy items and low prices and resell them to planets that are willing to pay more for those particular types of items.

Planets also allow you to refuel your ship or to heal your character. Though you can drift through space in one direction without cost to fuel, it does cost fuel to change your trajectory. You are able to fly through stars if they are in your way, but your character will take damage. Plan your route accordingly.

Random events occur throughout the game that can benefit or harm you, so be careful.
